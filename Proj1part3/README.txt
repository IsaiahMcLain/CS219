#Project part 3, For CS 219 Computer Organization

>This project is meant to work with assembly code
 by reading assembly code from a file and using c++ 
 as a middle man to process the assembly commands 
 and operands in whatever way is stated in the file
 and output the results to the user. This includes basic 
 commands such as ADD, NOT, AND, XOR, etc. This version adds 
 on the extension of using registers. The code executes the operations
 and stores the reults in 1 of 7 registers just like an actual CPU 
 does in memory. 

##Installation 
 >Must use linux and have make installed on computer
 >May also use Microsoft VisualStudioCode if setup in
 your environment but will not be discussed in this file

##Usage Example 
 >Navigate to build folder in console terminal
 >make Assembly
